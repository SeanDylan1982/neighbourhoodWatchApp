You can filter the audit log by action type and time range.

## Best Practices

1. **Document Actions**: Always provide a clear reason when moderating content or suspending users
2. **Regular Monitoring**: Check the admin dashboard regularly for flagged content and suspicious activity
3. **Gradual Escalation**: Start with warnings before suspending users for minor infractions
4. **Audit Review**: Periodically review the audit log to ensure proper administrative actions

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the admin panel:

1. **Access Denied**: Ensure your account has admin privileges
2. **Missing Data**: Check network connectivity and refresh the page
3. **Failed Actions**: Look for error messages and try again
4. **System Stats Issues**: Verify that the backend services are running properly
